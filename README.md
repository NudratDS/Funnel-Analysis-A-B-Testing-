📊 Funnel Analysis Project

This project focuses on analyzing a user conversion funnel to understand where users drop off in the journey toward completing a key action (e.g., making a purchase). The goal is to identify the weakest points in the funnel and make data-driven recommendations to improve conversion rates.

🧭 Project Objective

To perform funnel analysis on a user journey and answer:

How many users reach each step of the funnel?

Where are the biggest drop-offs?

What is the overall conversion rate?

How do funnel metrics vary by segments (e.g., variant A vs. B, campaign, device, etc.)?

📄 Dataset Overview

The dataset contains user interactions across different steps in a funnel:

Column Name	Description
user_id	Unique user identifier
step_1_view	Whether the user visited the homepage
step_2_cart	Whether the user added a product to cart
step_3_checkout	Whether the user proceeded to checkout
step_4_purchase	Whether the user completed a purchase
variant	(Optional) A/B test group (A or B)
campaign	(Optional) Source of traffic or campaign ID
🔍 Analysis Performed

Count of users at each funnel step

Drop-off rate between steps

Overall and step-wise conversion rates

Funnel visualization

Segment-wise funnel comparison (if data available)

📊 Key Metrics
Funnel Step	Users Remaining	Conversion Rate
Homepage View	5,000	100%
Add to Cart	3,200	64%
Checkout	1,500	30%
Purchase	1,000	20%

(Example numbers — replace with your actual output)

📈 Visualizations

Bar chart showing drop-off at each step

Funnel diagram

Conversion rate comparison between A/B test variants (if applicable)

🧠 Insights

Highest drop-off observed between Add to Cart → Checkout

Funnel conversion rate from View → Purchase is 20%

Variant B showed slightly higher checkout rate, but not statistically significant

✅ Recommendations

Simplify checkout process to reduce abandonment

Add trust badges or progress indicators on checkout page

Consider retargeting users who added to cart but didn’t checkout
